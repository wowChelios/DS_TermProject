## Introduction
Repository of term project for course Data Science for Business Analytics. Predicting readmission rate of diabetic patients. [link of dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

## Business Problem
The issue of unnecessary readmission has always been a headache for not only hospitals and patients, but also for healthcare companies. According to data from the Center for Health Information and Analysis, hospital readmissions cost Medicare about $17 billion annually. Reducing readmission rate is one of the top approaches for insurance companies to lower their medical costs. In our project, with constraints of the dataset, we are focusing on own diabetic patients’ readmission problem.

## Use Scenario
Although all the medical test requested from patients have met the standard before their discharge, there might be other factors could affect their chance of been readmitted. With our model, the health company can predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days. With those patients with higher probabilities, further actions will be necessary like remain in hospital under observation.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, with the prediction of patients’ readmission, the healthcare company could evaluate patients before they leave the hospital whether any further treatment is necessary to prevent them from readmit. Lower readmission rate will eventually lead to the reduction of avoidable medical costs such as transportation and longer hospitalization of the readmission.
